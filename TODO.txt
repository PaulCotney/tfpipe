#TODO 

##Top Priorities
collect set pipelines in centralized location, merge changes 
meta data 
    job log file, stats log file
config file
dump file name and description (need to provide descriptions to jobs to get
     full value out of this.  Maybe add to config file?

##Display
way to display job attributes/data not just command line
output meta-data information so pipeline is easy to look at 


##Config
configuration file 
    prevent hardcoding
    easily swap between species, etc.


##Format
should there be a driver script and config files get passed to pipeline?
could have something like python tfpipe.py --method ATAC --config config.file
would make modularization easier
There was an argument against
    separate pipeline scripts would be easier to grok


##Cluster
handle orphaned jobs, or is this outside the scope?
Could dump status to db (could be configured in config file)
    could give print out of what happened


##Jobs
modules and versioning.  What to do if a specific module version no longer 
    exists on Kure? Always default, but able to specify specific versions 
    instead, or just keep versions up-to-date in the framework like 
    MaPSeq?
    Too much to keep track of.  Could use specific versions and fail if doesn't
    exist
