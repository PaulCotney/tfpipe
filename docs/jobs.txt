JOBS

Overview
========

tfpipe/base.py defines class Job. It is the base class for all jobs created 
with tfpipe.


Methods
=======


add_argument
------------

Method adds command line arguments to object.

    >>> job1.add_argument('-c')
    >>> job1.add_argument('-i', 'some.file')


add_bsub_argument
-----------------

Method adds command line arguments to future bsub command.

    >>> job1.add_bsub_argument('-q', 'bigmem')


add_dependencies
----------------

Add job dependencies to job object.  Method allows user to add dependency 
arguments to current job.  User specifies under what dependency condition each 
job is located, and has ability to specify the dependency string.  Dependency 
conditions must be of type list.

If user does not specify a dependency string, tfpipe will make a best guess 
based on keys from the dependency dictionary.

Please see below.


add_jobname
-----------

Add name to current job. 


get_command
-----------

Display job shell representation at current state.


redirect_output
---------------

Method to redirect output in the Unix sense.


show
----
Display job shell representation at current state.

show_as_list
------------

Output command as list.


Dependencies
============

Pipelines, by definition, require dependencies at some point in the workflow. 
This means that the output of a job may be the input to another.  In this 
scenario, the second job cannot start until the first has completed.  LSF 
doesn't know how to handle this without the '-w' argument.  Depending on your 
workflow, you may want the second job to start only after successful completion 
of the first job, or you may want your second job to start once the first has 
exited with any code.  To specify the behavior of your pipeline, reference the 
'Dependency Conditions' section below.


Dependency Conditions
---------------------

1. done(job_ID | "job_name")
2. ended(job_ID | "job_name")
3. exit(job_ID [,[op] exit_code])
4. exit("job_name"[,[op] exit_code])
5. external(job_ID | "job_name", "status_text")
6. post_done(job_ID | "job_name")
7. post_err(job_ID | "job_name")
8. started(job_ID | "job_name")

****Currently, you can only specify job_name.  [op] and exit_code will be 
available soon.****


Specifying Dependency
---------------------

The easiest way to specify a job dependency is to use the 'add_dependency' 
method.  Using this method, you specify a dependency string and any dependency 
conditions needed to satisfy your string.  Unlike the following method, you do 
not have to specify job names.  Tfpipe will do that for you.  Here is an 
example:

    >>> job3 = FastxClipper()
    >>> job3.add_dependency(dep_str='done||exited', 
                            done=[job1,], 
                            exited=[job2,])

You do not have to specify job names, but you have to specify the dependency 
condition. The above commands will initialize job3 and update the 'dep_str' to 
'done(SomeJobNameforJob1)||exited(JobNameForJob2)'.  

If you have a more complicated dep_str, like 'done||(done&&exited)', you will 
have to have the number of jobs in your done list equal to the number of dones 
in your dep_str. For example:

    >>> job4.add_dependency(done=[job1, job2], exited=[job3])

Now, assume you forgot to specify a dep_str and you entered something like:

    >>> job3.add_dependency(done=[jo1,], exited=[job3,])

Tfpipe assumes '&&' by default. Your dep_str will be 'done&&exited'. If you need 
'||', you will have to specify that explicitly.

Finally, the 'dep_str' can be specified during job initialization, like so:

    >>> job2 = FastxClipper(dep_str='exited(myFirstJob)')

The user MUST use job1's name, NOT the job1's variable name (job1.name => 
'myFirstJob' NOT job1).  This has to be done explicitly and must be exactly what 
LSF expects to see.  You can consider this an override option.


Arguments
=========

Adding Arguments
----------------

There are two ways to add arguments to your job.  You can either add the
arguments in Dictionary format when initializing your job, or you can use the 
add_arguments method.

    >>> job1 = FastqQualityFilter(args={'-i': 'somefile.fastq', 
                                        '-o': 'outfile.fastq'})

    >>> job1 = FastqQualityFilter()
    >>> job1.add_argument('-i', 'somefile.fastq')
    >>> job1.add_argument('-o', 'outfile.fastq')

If you have an argument that is only one string (-u or --stuff=10), you can 
set the string equal to the key with an empty value.  Kind of a hack at the 
moment.  I will have a better solution soon.

    >>> job1 = Gsnap(args={'--terminal-threshold=10': ''})

    >>> job1 = Gsnap()
    >>> job1.add_argument('--terminal-threshold=10', '')
