Dependencies
============

Pipelines, by definition, require dependencies at some point in the workflow. 
This means that the output of a job may be the input to another.  In this 
scenario, the second job cannot start until the first has completed.  LSF 
doesn't know how to handle this without the '-w' argument.  Depending on your 
workflow, you may want the second job to start only after successful completion 
of the first job, or you may want your second job to start once the first has 
exited with any code.  To specify the behavior of your pipeline, reference the 
'Dependency Conditions' section below.


Dependency Conditions
---------------------

1. done(job_ID | "job_name")
2. ended(job_ID | "job_name")
3. exit(job_ID [,[op] exit_code])
4. exit("job_name"[,[op] exit_code])
5. external(job_ID | "job_name", "status_text")
6. post_done(job_ID | "job_name")
7. post_err(job_ID | "job_name")
8. started(job_ID | "job_name")
